Team: 
update from my side.

1) all code have been cleaned up, except the gym level data 
(should be done by tomm, @Isabella Li I need your code)

2) all code have been committed to github except data dump which are too large: https://github.com/lyt169/ba_aib_group4_oc-gym

3) if you have limited computing power to run the code, I uploaded the data dump onto Imperial's onedrive. Link here:

4) I have included a data_clean description file for membership_clean to explain what each attribute is and their format 

5) Please go ahead and answer the first 4 questions tomm using those data_dump as your base. The structure should roughly be:
	1) state the question
	2) state your hypothesis (multiple if needed)
	3) slice data, chart data, summerize data
	4) findings
	5) suggestions/conclusion

Note: they emphasised "SIMPLICITY is the key". That is why I created 4 folders under "notebook".

¡¾eda¡¿ - where you keep your first round of testings and findings (Faiz and Ming, your uploaded workbooks are also here)
¡¾modelling¡¿ - if you are running any models to support your answers ( I will use this to run the tree)
¡¾processing¡¿- this is the pre-processing part. It is done. You can find my cleaning file "data_prepare.ipynb" in there
¡¾report¡¿ - this is where the FINAL clean and simple report resides. 

Please try your best to stick to this structure. Alex will appreciate the neatness of our work.

Chat tomorrow.

Cheers
